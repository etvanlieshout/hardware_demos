# hardware_demos
Demos from UB Sp22 Hackathon

Please take these Arduino sketches and play with them, improve them, and have fun!

NOTE: LED_example and synth_1.1 work. They could be improved, but they are basically functional. 

The other sketches (synth_0.1, synth_0.2, and synth_1.0) are NOT functional and included here for educational purposes, should anyone want to practice debugging someone else's terribly hacked together code.

To use the synth_1.1 demo (or other synth demos), you need to install the full Tone library. Do this by downloading the Tone directory in this repo and placing it in your Arduino/libraries directory.
Tone library was written by Brett Hagman. Documentation and source code is available here: https://github.com/bhagman/Tone

All other code by me.
